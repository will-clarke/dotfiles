Description: Synchronize Maildir and IMAP4 mailboxes
 A command line application which synchronizes mailboxes; currently
 Maildir and IMAP4 mailboxes are supported.
 New messages, message deletions and flag changes can be propagated both ways.
 It is useful for working in disconnected mode, such as on a laptop or with a
 non-permanent internet collection (dIMAP).
 .
 The main application was much improved in version 1.0. Those
 improvements lead to interface changes and the application being
 renamed to mbsync. The application isync is now only a wrapper to
 keep compatibility with earlier versions.
 .
 Features:
  * Fine-grained selection of synchronization operations to perform
  * Synchronizes single mailboxes or entire mailbox collections
  * Partial mirrors possible: keep only the latest messages locally
  * Trash functionality: backup messages before removing them
  * IMAP features:
    * Supports TLS/SSL via imaps: (port 993) and STARTTLS (RFC2595)
    * Supports CRAM-MD5 (RFC2195) for authentication
    * Supports NAMESPACE (RFC2342) for simplified configuration
    * Pipelining for maximum speed
